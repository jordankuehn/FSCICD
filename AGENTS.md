FSCICD is a **CI/CD system for LabVIEW code**. It runs Mass Compile and VI
Analyzer inside NI's official **headless LabVIEW containers**, renders an
HTML/JSON report, and posts a **Bitbucket** commit build status. Design is
**Option B**: Bitbucket is the code of record; repos are mirrored into GitHub so
the containerized LabVIEW CI runs on GitHub Actions.

Key packages:
- `src/fscicd/` — Python package. Entry point CLI is `fscicd` (see `cli.py`).
- `src/fscicd/labview/` — pluggable LabVIEW backends: `mock` (deterministic
  simulator, no LabVIEW needed) and `container` (real, `docker run` the NI image).
- `docker/labview-worker.Dockerfile`, `.github/workflows/labview-ci.yml`,
  `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` — the containerized CI + mirror plumbing.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

- **Python dev env lives in `.venv`.** After the update script runs, use
  `.venv/bin/<tool>` (e.g. `.venv/bin/pytest`, `.venv/bin/ruff`) or activate the
  venv. The package is installed editable, so `src/fscicd` edits take effect
  without reinstalling.
- **Standard commands** (all from repo root):
  - Lint: `.venv/bin/ruff check .` and `.venv/bin/ruff format --check .`
  - Tests: `.venv/bin/pytest`
  - YAML lint (CI configs): `.venv/bin/yamllint .github/workflows bitbucket-pipelines.yml examples/fscicd.yml`
  - Run the app (mock): `.venv/bin/fscicd run --config examples/fscicd.yml --repo-path "examples/sample-labview-project" --commit demo`
- **LabVIEW cannot run in this VM.** There is no NI license/Docker image here, and
  the images are Windows/Linux multi-GB LabVIEW installs. Develop and test with
  `runner: mock` in `fscicd.yml`. The `container` runner's command construction is
  unit-tested, but real `docker run` execution only happens on a CI runner with
  Docker + the NI headless image. Do not treat "cannot run LabVIEW here" as a bug.
- **Everything is LabVIEW 2026 64-bit.** There is no support for older versions
  or 32-bit — do not add version/bitness branching. Headless mode (`-Headless` /
  `LV_RTE_HEADLESS=1`) skips license activation for CI, so no license server needs
  to be reachable from the runner.
- **Mock results are deterministic by file path** (seeded from the VI path): a VI
  whose name contains `broken` is reported broken, `missing` yields a missing
  dependency, VI Analyzer findings are stable per path, and a unit-test VI whose
  name contains `fail` (or `broken`) produces failing cases. Sample fixtures under
  `examples/sample-labview-project/` are named so the pipeline passes; the
  `examples/broken-project/` fixture is intentionally failing.
- **Capabilities live in `src/fscicd/capabilities/`** and are wired in
  `pipeline.py`. Adding one = new capability module + runner method (mock +
  container) + a report section in `templates/report.html.j2` + config in
  `config.py`. Unit tests are discovered via `test_globs` (default matches
  `*Test*.vi` and files under a `Tests/` folder).
- **Bitbucket credentials come from env vars only** (`BITBUCKET_USERNAME` +
  `BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD`, or `BITBUCKET_ACCESS_TOKEN`). With none set, status
  posting runs in dry-run mode, so the pipeline is fully runnable offline.
- **Reports** are written to `build/reports/` (git-ignored). `fscicd run` exits
  non-zero (2) when the pipeline status is FAILED — expected for the broken fixture.
